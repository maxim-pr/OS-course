Having too little buffer size (1 or 2 bytes) decreases time consumption of the program


With -DSYNC:

DBUF_SIZE=1
real	0m1,640s
user	0m0,000s
sys	0m0,259s

DBUF_SIZE=2
real	0m1,024s
user	0m0,000s
sys	0m0,166s

DBUF_SIZE=4
real	0m0,514s
user	0m0,007s
sys	0m0,071s

DBUF_SIZE=8
real	0m0,352s
user	0m0,000s
sys	0m0,054s

DBUF_SIZE=16
real	0m0,158s
user	0m0,000s
sys	0m0,025s

DBUF_SIZE=32
real	0m0,091s
user	0m0,001s
sys	0m0,013s

With -DSYNC flag, the same, the less the buffer size, the more time consumption is. 
But with this flag, the time consumption is much greater than without it.
